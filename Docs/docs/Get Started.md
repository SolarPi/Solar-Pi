# Get Started

Your Solar Pi is a Raspberry Pi based computer. It can do almost anything you want, if you know how to program it. We aim to teach you how to use a computer and how to code, so that you have an advantage over others when you get employed.

Good luck, and we hope that you enjoy using your Solar Pi!

## Input
### Touchscreen

Your Solar Pi has a touchscreen. This means that you can use your finger to touch the screen and control the computer. You can press buttons, access menus and look through this documentation. Also, you can use the on screen keyboard by clicking on the icon in the toolbar at the top of the screen.

### Keyboard & Trackpad
Your Solar Pi also comes with a keyboard and trackpad. This makes it easier to use your Solar Pi when typing a lot or doing tasks that can't be done with the touchscreen. You will need to regularly charge your keyboard, and this can be done my plugging it into one of your Solar Pi's USB ports.
