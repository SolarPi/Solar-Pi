# Getting Started

Your Solar Pi is a Raspberry Pi based computer. It can do almost anything you want, if you know how to program it. We aim to teach you how to use a computer and how to code, so that you have an advantage over others when you get employed.

Good luck, and we hope that you enjoy using your Solar Pi!

## Input
### Touchscreen

Your Solar Pi has a touchscreen. This means that you can use your finger to touch the screen and control the computer. You can press buttons, access menus and look through this documentation. Also, you can use the on screen keyboard by clicking on the icon in the toolbar at the top of the screen.

### Keyboard & Trackpad
You can also use a keyboard and trackpad. This makes it easier to use your Solar Pi when typing a lot or doing tasks that can't be done with the touchscreen.

To use it, press the buttons on the keyboard to get the letters and numbers you want, and drag your finger around the trackpad to move the cursor (the black pointer). To click, tap on the trackpad, or press down on the bottom left area. You can also right click, by pressing down on the bottom right of the touchpad. This will bring up an additional menu.

You will need to regularly charge your keyboard, and this can be done my plugging it into one of your Solar Pi's USB ports.

## The Raspbian Desktop

This is the 'heart' of the operating system. At the top left corner, there is a button to go to the Main Menu. From here you can launch all the progams that are installed on your Solar Pi.
There are icons that sit on the desktop. You can make shortcuts to different programs, or you can save files here.

### File Manager

The default file manager for Raspbian is PCmanFM. This has the icon that looks like an open yellow folder. With this, you can browse the files on the system.
