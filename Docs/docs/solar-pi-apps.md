# Solar Pi Apps

You Solar Pi comes with a few custom apps that we have written to help you use your Solar Pi. Here, we'll explain what each one is for, and how to use them.

## Solar Pi Welcome
This is the main Solar Pi app that you see when you first log on to your Solar Pi. The toolbar at the top gives you options to shutdown, reboot of log out of your Pi. Also, you can change settings, open the file manager, see what the Solar Pi project is about and read these docs.
