# About

The Solar Pi project aims to bring flexible and affordable Raspberry Pi based computers to developing countries to provide people with digital skills.

The flexibility of the Solar Pi is what sets it apart from its competitors - it's not limited to only computing and coding; the fact that it can load and host offline web pages allows it to be used to teach almost anything. Its modular design also ensures that parts can be easily replaced if they fail, and allows individual units to be easily configured to the recipient's specifications.

Enjoy! :)
