# Hardware
Your Solar Pi is made up of many different parts; this page is here to tell you about them.

## Raspberry Pi 3 Model B

This is the heart of your Solar Pi. This is the 'computer' part of the Solar Pi, as it lets you do just about anything - without it, your Solar Pi would be useless. It's also got the last part of our name ('Pi')!

## 19W Foldable Solar Panels

This has got the first part of our name ('Solar'), as it is also a important part of the Solar Pi. This provides power to all the components, and allows it to work in remote locations.

## Waveshare 7 Inch 1024x600 Touchscreen

This is the Solar Pi's display that also acts as an input device. This allows you to interact with the Raspberry Pi, as it displays items on the screen and acts as a combined mouse and keyboard.

## 4 x 2250mAh (9000mAh total) Canwelum Batteries

These store power for your Solar Pi, and allow it to run indoors and where there isn't very much sunlight.

## Pico UPS HAT

This is attatched on top of the Raspberry Pi to ensure that the batteries power it correctly, and tell it when the battery level is running low.

## Mini Keyboard + Touchpad

This is an alternative input device that makes it easier for you to type large chunks of code and navigate Raspbian and other applications with better precision.
